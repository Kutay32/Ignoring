# Qwen2.5 VL Model Fix Summary

## Problem
The error `'Qwen2_5_VLModel' object has no attribute 'generate'` was occurring because the code was using `AutoModel` instead of `Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration` to load the Qwen models.

## Root Cause
- `AutoModel` loads the base model without generation capabilities
- `Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration` is the correct class that includes the `generate` method
- The `generate` method is essential for text generation in vision-language models

## Files Fixed
1. **signature_extractor.py** - Main signature extractor
2. **signature_extractor_backup.py** - Backup version
3. **signature_extractor_minimal.py** - Minimal version
4. **advanced_signature_detector.py** - Advanced detector

## Changes Made
For each file, I updated:

### Import Statement
```python
# Before
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoProcessor

# After
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoProcessor
```

### Model Loading
```python
# Before
self.model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    self.model_name, 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16 if self.device == "cuda" else torch.float32,
    device_map="auto" if self.device == "cuda" else None,
    trust_remote_code=True
)

# After
self.model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    self.model_name, 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16 if self.device == "cuda" else torch.float32,
    device_map="auto" if self.device == "cuda" else None,
    trust_remote_code=True
)
```

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. The model object has the `generate` method available
2. Text generation will work correctly
3. Vision-language processing will function as expected
4. All existing functionality remains intact

## Test Script
Created `test_fixed_qwen.py` to verify the fix works correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies in a virtual environment
2. Run the test script to verify the fix
3. Test with actual image processing if needed

The fix addresses the core issue and should resolve the `'Qwen2_5_VLModel' object has no attribute 'generate'` error.
